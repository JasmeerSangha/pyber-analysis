# Pyber Analysis

### Analysis
The summary data frame within pyber_challenge summarizes the pyber data by city type. Total drivers and rides, and thus total fares increase with respect to the urbanization of the cities. It is interesting to note that the average fare per ride and per driver decreases as a city becomes more urbanized. We can interpret this to be due to the fact that urban cities will have ammenities in closer proximity thus the average rie fare will be cheaper. Furthermore each driver on average earned less the more urbanized their city was, showing that that even though demand for rides increases the supply of drivers grows faster.

In terms of the "Weekly Total Fares by City Type" plot we can see the weekly fares for each city type look relatively constant through the four month period. As expected, the more populous a city, the more revenue it earns.
